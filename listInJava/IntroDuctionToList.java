	 * 
	 * List extends Collection 
	 * 1.LinkedList
	 * 2.ArrayList
	 * 3.Stack
	 * 4.Vector
	 * 
	 * The Above are the types of list which implements 
	 * list in its structures.
	 * 
	 * 1. ArrayList
	 * ----> It is the resizable arrays which is used to strore same types of 
	 *       data types...
	 *       
	 *       List<String> arrayList = new ArrayList<String>();
	 *       
	 * 2. LinkedList
	 * 
	 *   ---> It is also a generic class implementing the List interface
	 *       It can be of any datatypes.
	 *       It is used to store data but not in contigous manner as well
	 *       
//	 *  //Difference between LinkedList and ArrayList is That
 * 
	 *  LinkedList is not in contigous manner but the
	 *  arraylist should be in contigous manner
	 *  -> the insertion and deletion at any index except last is easier in 
	 *    LinkedList but in ArrayList you have to adjust the remaining 
	 *    elements you have.
	 *    
	 *    -> The insertion in the last is easier in the ArrayList But not 
	 *    the LinkedList.
	 *    
	 *    List<Integer> linkedlist = new LinkedList<Integer>();
	 *    
	 *    
	 * 3. Vectors
	 * 
	 * ---> This works exactly in the same way as the arraylist
	 * 		but the only difference is that it is not thread safe
	 *      as it syncronises each methods (It automatically implies
	 *      some lock on its methods).
	 *      
	 *      We should use arrayList in place of vectors because vectors are 
	 *      not threadsafe... 
	 *      
	 *      ArrayList grows by the multiple of 1.5
	 *      whereas Vectors grows by the multiple of 2
	 *      So arraylist saves the space also
	 *      
	 * 4. Stack
	 * 
	 * --->  The stack is used LAST INT FIRST OUT
	 * 		 LIFO
	 * 		push()
	 * 		pop()
	 * 		peek()
	 * 		search()
	 * 		isEmpty()
	 * 		Most important data structures
	 *
